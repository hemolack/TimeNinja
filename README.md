#### Why does this exist?
A few years ago I was working as a consultant at a small company (small like five people).  I had been brought over by someone I had worked for in the past and was comfortable working with again.  About three months after I started the owner of the company got into a fight with my friend and demanded that we both use a particular time tracking software as a measure of revenge -- sort of a petty power move.  Not just any tracking software, though, a rather obnoxious piece of software that tracks every mouse movement and keystroke, as well as taking screen shots of your desktop on a regular basis.  Not only that, but being a consultant, I was often on conference calls with my client, which meant that I was not active on the computer.  The software took the liberty of marking me as "not working" during these times.  So I had to sit and constantly jiggle the mouse or press random keys to keep from appearing to be idle.  To make matters even worse, my client was a healthcare organization, meaning that any screenshots taken of my laptop could very well include protected health information (PHI) -- a huge proglem.

So I got to thinking.  Obviously I had been lumped in with my friend and coworker in the owner's attempt to exert control.  But I wasn't a data entry worker bee, I am a knowledge worker, often designing on whiteboards and not constantly at the keyboard.  My attempts to reason with the owner were met with harsh rebuffs.  So I decided to do what any good developer does when confronted with a soul-killing repetitive task: I automated it.
